              The prime minister of a rich African country rules, as befits an
              absolute tyrant. It comes to the point that he begins to develop
              a nuclear program, supposedly for peaceful purposes. Standing guard
              over the world order of the United States invites an exotic dictator
              to a UN meeting, where he gladly arrives. But it turns out that he
              was afraid of America in vain, since the war takes place behind his
              back, and he is assigned the role of the victim.

              Maleficent 2 - the long-awaited continuation
              of the story of the blonde princess Aurora and
              the dark-horned sorceress Maleficent, which life
              made to become such. Initially, the picture was
              set based on a completely revised story of the
              old cartoon of the Walt Disney studio Sleeping Beauty.
              The continuation develops a difficult relationship between
              the two heroines, but now a new female character is added to
              the story - Queen Ingrid.
